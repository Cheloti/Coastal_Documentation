Introduction
==============
Shoreline extraction is the process of identifying the position of the land-water interface in satellite images.
It is an important task for various applications, such as coastline change detection and coastal zone management.
The task of shoreline extraction is very difficult, time-consuming, and sometimes impossible for entire coastal systems 
when using traditional ground survey techniques.

 Advanced remote sensing (RS) and geographic information system (GIS) techniques are being used for detection of shoreline position and change analysis.
 For accurate subpixel accuracy for characterising the shoreline changes, an automated way/tool for shoreline extraction in required.

 In general, the shoreline extraction process involves obtaining satellite images, pre-processing the data, and applying machine learning algorithms to extract the shoreline.

 How accurate are the machine learning algorithms in extracting shorelines?
 ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 The accuracy of machine learning algorithms in shoreline extraction depends on various factors such as quality of the satellite images, the complexity of the shoreline, and the type 
 of machine learning algorithm used.

 For instance, a study by Celik and Gazioglou (2022) assessed the accuracy of three machine learning classifier groups (Support Vector Machines, Multilayer Perceptron (MLP), 
 and Ensemble Learning classifiers) on different coastal types for coastline extraction. The authors tested four kernel functions and four activation functions and found that 
 the Random Forest algorithm had better accuracy than the SVM algorithm. The overall accuracy values of all maps were 97.18%, and the kappa coefficient was 0.97 for RF algorithm, 
 while for SVM algorithm, the mean overall accuracy and kappa coefficient of maps were 85.15% and 0.79, respectively 

Another study by Zhang et al. (2019) proposed a deep learning-based method for shoreline extraction from Sentinel-2 images. The authors used a U-Net architecture with a ResNet-50 encoder to 
extract shorelines from Sentinel-2 images. The proposed method achieved an overall accuracy of 96.7% on a test dataset.

However, it is important to note that the accuracy of machine learning algorithms in shoreline extraction is not always perfect and can be affected by various factors such as weather conditions, 
image quality, and other environmental factors. Therefore, it is important to validate the results of any machine learning algorithm with ground truth data or other reliable sources.

Challenges in automated shoreline Extraction
---------------------------------------------
Automated shoreline extraction is a complex task that involves several challenges. Some of these challenges include: |br|
| * **Image quality:** The quality of the satellite images can affect the accuracy of the shoreline extraction process. Poor image quality can lead to errors in the detection of the shoreline.
| * **Shoreline complexity:** The complexities of the shoreline has been the major challenge in the automatic shoreline process especially the coastlines of Madagascar which has complex geometries coupled with many inlets and bays.
* **Weather conditions:** Weather conditions such as cloud cover, fog and haze affects the quality of satellite images especially with optical satellite images which makes it difficult to extract shorelines accurately.
* **Environmental factors:** Environmental factors such as such as tides, waves, and currents can also affect the accuracy of shoreline extraction.
* **Machine learning algorithms:** The choice of machine learning algorithm used for shoreline extraction can also affect its accuracy. Different algorithms have different strengths and weaknesses,  and choosing the right one for a particular application is important.
* **Ground truth data** Validating the results of machine learning algorithms with ground truth data/other reliable sources is important to ensure their accuracy.

shoreline extraction applications
----------------------------------
Shoreline extraction has several applications in various fields. Some of the applications of shoreline extraction include:
* **Coastal zone management:** Shoreline extraction can be used to monitor changes in the coastline and assess the impact of human activities on the coastal environment.
* **Coastal erosion monitoring** It can be used to monitor the rate of coastal erosion and identify areas that are at risk of erosion.
* **Marine ecology** Shoreline extraction can be used to study the distribution and abundance of marine organisms along the coast.
* **Coastal engineering** Shoreline extraction can be used to design coastal structures such as breakwaters, jetties, and seawalls.
* **Navigation** Shorelne extraction can be used to create nautical charts and maps for navigation purposes.
